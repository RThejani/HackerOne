## Introduction

This repository serves as a centralized location to document security vulnerabilities and findings that have been reported and resolved through the HackerOne platform. The goal is to share insights, lessons learned, and best practices related to cybersecurity through real-world examples.

## Findings

Browse the [Findings](findings/) directory to explore a list of security vulnerabilities and findings. Each finding is documented in its own directory, containing information about the vulnerability, its impact, steps to reproduce, and the resolution. This repository aims to serve as both a learning resource and a historical record of cybersecurity issues.

Feel free to contribute your own findings by following the guidelines outlined in the [Contributing](#contributing) section.
